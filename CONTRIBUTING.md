You can contribute to [this repository](https://github.com/CSTGit/CST-Live-Guide) by two ways, either _online_ or _offline_.

Any constructive contribution are welcome. Small contribution can be just fix a typo, big contribution may be writing a complete section or even a whole chapter. 

This article assumes a reader with some basic knowledge to computer, but know nothing to Git. If you are familiar with Git and GitHub, you can jump to [Project Directory Mapping](#project_directory_mapping).

## Create a GitHub account

This is a simple step. The right part of [GitHub homepage](https://github.com) is a register form. Just fill that form, verify email, then you have a GitHub account to make a contribution.

## Fork this repository

_This step can be ignored if you just want to make a small change, for example fix a typo. See [Edit Online](#online_edit) below._

Go to [the homepage of this repository](https://github.com/CSTGit/CST-Live-Guide), you can see the button `Fork` lies in the top right of that page. Click it, you will get a **fork** of this repository.

The term ["fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) here means a copy of repository _at that time_, just like what a real fork in the kitchen looks like, it separates at a specific position, then all branches are going up simultaneously.

When you have a fork of repository, you have a modifiable copy of this repository. You can do a new develop base on others' work, and request the original author to accept your develop whenever you want.

## Edit online

_Choose this one or the next one by yourself. In my opinion, online edit is more convenient when you just want to make small change. Make a big change, for example write a full article, offline edit is better._
